			<p>I am a software engineer experienced in full stack web development and knowledgeable in data structures and algorithms. I've been a devout problem solver since I was a kid when puzzles like the Rubik's Cube were a favorite pastime (I never even took them apart!). I still have the same passion for diving into complex challenges and crafting elegant, functional solutions. 
			<br><br>
			I am currently seeking full-time Software Engineer positions on a passionate team working on an impactful project. Work-life balance and an autonomous environment are important to me. You can contact me at mail@timsfchin.com.

			<a href="http://www.github.com/timothychin/nimbus-mobile"><h1>Nimbus</h1></a>
			<h3>The Problem</h3>
			<p>Nimbus was born from the very simple idea of wanting to track places to be cautious of in San Francisco.  One afternoon, walking back to our office from lunch, my team and I encountered a homeless lady who flung her fresh, moist feces at one of us (he narrowly dodged it).  As we were talking about the experience, we joked around about how we should create an app that allows users to drop pins at certain locations to warn other users about wild poops or other dangers they should avoid.  As we discussed it further, I realized that this app could solve a problem that modern social media apps have yet to seem to tackle.  Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook all provide great social services in very user-friendly interfaces, but one thing that lacks is a clarity of spatial association.  Instagram and Facebook do display locations if the user provides it, but it is a secondary function. The map view on Yelp’s app seems to be the closest to what we sought to achieve with Nimbus, the tradeoff being ease of viewing each post.</p>
			<section>
				<h3>The Solution</h3>
				<p>What I envisioned was an app where the home page displayed your location on a map, on which you could browse around and see pins of events around you—something akin to a bird’s eye view of events.  You can then click on the events to see a photo or video with a caption.  To maintain this idea of a real-time bird’s eye view of events, pins would expire after 24 hours, imitating the effect of Snapchat stories.</p>

			<a href="http://www.github.com/timothychin/tubenotes"><h1>TubeNotes</h1></a>
			<p>Tubenotes was created around the idea of being able to take notes while watching YouTube videos and having easy accessibility to the time in the video at which the note was taken. This was later expanded into an overlayed canvas on top of the YouTube video with controls that allowed a user to draw on the video while watching it.  A "Replay Annotation" button sends the user to the beginning of the video and replays the video, with their annotations rendering live, line-by-line as if they were drawing it again.  My team added a social aspect to TubeNotes, allowing users to form and join groups and share videos within their group.
